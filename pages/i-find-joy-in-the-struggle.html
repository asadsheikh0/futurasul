        <p>"i find joy in the struggle." - my dad to me, but someone else probably said it first</p>
        <p>
            sometimes creative work feels like a struggle. 
            self-doubt clouds confidence & clarity. 
            i found it difficult to create for a few months after launching this page.
            i wasn't sure if my ideas were good enough and was so wrapped up in trying to come up with the best execution possible that i couldn't even start to begin with.
        </p>
        <p>
            over the past few weeks, i had to cancel my holiday plans at the last second. this left me with all the time in the world to create & catalog.
        </p>
        <p>there is a joy i found in this struggle against my own doubts & insecurities. letting go of my ego allows me to create more freely, share more openly. </p>
        <p>as i carve this space into the Internet, i look forward to the struggle ahead, it will bring me much joy.</p>

        <p>back design is arabic text that reads "Fana Fi Allah," meaning "self-annihilation."</p>
        <p>the concept comes from Sufism, a form of Islamic mysticism, defined as the absolute annihilation of the human ego before God.</p>
        <p>extending this concept into my art practice allows me to create for the sake of creating. there is no value attached by the number of people who see this, because i only find value through the process.</p>

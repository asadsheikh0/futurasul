        <p>i fell in love with an exhibition on indian court paintings last year, particularly this folio titled “Mihrdukht Aims her Arrow at the Ring.” Mirdukht was a famous archeress who had suitors compete for her hand by shooting an arrow through a ring which had been placed at the top of a tall pole.</p>
        <p>i was particularly drawn to her sheer covering, and reimagined it as a minimalist poncho. made out of organza and covered with embroidered sigils, it is light, airy, and most importantly, edgy.</p>
